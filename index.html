  	<p> I recently purchased a monitor for my home setup and was looking for a fun side project to work on. I had some spare WS2812 leds lying around and an arduino which I used for my <a href="/musicled.html">Music controlled LEDs
  		project</a>. One post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations"> r/battlestations</a> caught my attention and I decided to mod my monitor with a ambilight. I was familiar with some software but making it wok on mac os was a bit challenging. Before I explain how I accomplished that here's a video of the ambilight in action.

  	<h1 id="header-1">Hardware</h1>
  	This is a list of hardware components used and the links to buy them. Note that I bought most of the electronic components from China using <a href="www.banggood.in">banggood.in</a> as it was considerably cheaper. You can source them locally if you dont want to wait for the components.
  	<ul>
	  	<li><a href="https://www.banggood.in/0_5M1M2M3M4M5M-USB-RGB-5050-Non-waterproof-WS2812-LED-TV-Strip-LightRemote-Control-Kit-DC5V-p-1259190.html?rmmds=myorder&ID=44707&cur_warehouse=CN">WS2812 LED strip: </a> I found this one to be the cheapest and best suited for my purpose. The strip comes with a LED controller with built-in effects and can be controlled by a remote which is included. My LED controller broke within a few days though but it's a nice addition if you wish them as stand alone lighting</li>

	  	<li><a href="https://www.banggood.in/Wholesale-Arduino-Compatible-R3-UNO-ATmega16U2-AVR-USB-Board-p-68537.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN">Arduino UNO</a> I brought this one because I wanted to learn how to use arduino. You can probably work with Arduino Nano if you want some thing cheaper</li>
	</ul>

	I also brought a soldering iron, set of wires and other electronic items like breadboard but you can probably use the one's you already hav lying around. If you don't have these, search for the cheapest one's on banggood and buy them.
