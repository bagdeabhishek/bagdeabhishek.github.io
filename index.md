# About me
I am an energetic and outgoing person who loves to interact with people. I love to trek and cycle and generally enjoy company. Below is a short bio of me. 

## Professional and Educational Background

I've worked previously with Salesforce as a Member of Technical Staff with the Industries Surveys team initially and then with Detection and response team as a ML engineer. I currently work with Nvidia as ML platform engineer.  

I completed my Masters' in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in 2019. Before that I completed my Bachelors in Engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Engineering College in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. I have completed my schooling from Holy Cross English High School, Aurangabad.

I've completed my Masters as a Research Assistant with the System Adminstrators of CSE department. My M.Tech thesis was in "Fake News detection: Fact checking and Bias Detection" with <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sudarsha"> Prof. S. Sudarshan </a> and was co-guided by <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen">Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti</a>. The pdf of the final report can be found <a href="../pdfs/mtp_report.pdf">here</a> here. 

My main interests are in the fields of NLP, Machine learning and general system administration. I love to hack around using arduino and Raspberry pi. 

## Hobbies
I love trekking and I've completed multiple hard to medium difficulty treks in western ghats and Himalayas. My other interests include reading books, mainly biographies, Non-fiction and I'm starting with fiction(moslty fantasy and sci-fi).

I love watching movies and I'm proud of the reviews I've written for movies I've watched as part of my Institute Elective called "Perspectives on World Cinema". You can check out the pdf <a href="../pdfs/DE_410.pdf">here</a>

## Social Media links
I mainly use [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bagdeabhishek) for keeping up with friends, I rarely post any updates though. I update all the books i've read on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/bagdeabhishek). I maintain professional acquaintance through my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bagdeabhishek/) profile. Anyone who wishes to get in touch can mail me on [bagdeabhishek@gmail.com](mailto:bagdeabhishek@gmail.com). I've also written some answers on [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Abhishek-Bagade)

Ever since WFH began I've been travelling and working from some nice locations in India. I've been encouraged by my friends to start documenting these travels. Since then I've been active on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bagdeabhishek/) (after 6 long years!) and also I've been posting some travelogues on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/AbhishekBagade)

# GATE and M.Tech related stuff

* [Life at IIT Bombay](https://www.mixcloud.com/careerhunt/life-at-iit-bombay-by-abhishek-bagade-and-ashish-mitole/)
This is a podcast I did along with Ashish Mithole to give an idea of the life at IIT Bombay as a M.Tech student.

* [Information about RA Interview process](https://www.facebook.com/groups/core.cs/permalink/1435736943125221/)
This is a facebook post which I had written initially as introduction to RA interview process at IIT Bombay. Keep in mind the process is highly dynamic and changes every year, I've updated the post for the years I was there but for latest information its better you contact current RAs.

* [Difference between RA and TA at IIT Bombay](https://qr.ae/TWIW33)
This is a quora answer comparing the Research Assistant program and the Teaching Assistant program.

# Side projects 
* [DIY Ambilight using Arduino and WS2812 LEDs](../ambilight)
This is a very cool side project I did. This project fits your monitor with LED ambilight which are generally part of expensive TVs. The Ambilight works great and provides a more immersive= experience. Here it is in action

* [A plant only aquarium in a bottle! ](../jarrarium)
I saw this on reddit, and decided to give it a go. This looks hella cool and should be a fun hobby.

* [Create your own Home Server (or as people at reddit call it, HomeLab)](../homelab)
I always wanted to have my own HomeServer for a number of reasons and I finally managed to create one for cheap. This blog post goes over the decisions, both software and Hardware, I had to make and the reasons behind them. Follow this blog post to get started with a HomeLab of your own. 

* [A network analysis of tweets from political handles](../twitterAnalysis)
I did this as fun side project, I crawled tweets using [multi-threaded tweet crawler](https://github.com/bagdeabhishek/TweetCrawlMultiThreaded) (which I wrote). You can check out the interactive version of the network graph [here](../twitter_graph.html).
In this project I created a social media influence graph using retweets and applied clustering to see how certain political communities behave. 

* [Run your dual boot linux installation as a VM](../dualbootasVM)
I did this because I was tired of having to switch between Windows and Linux installations. I have regular crawls and services set up which I needed to access across systems. I used my homelab to host these services before but since the COVID lockdown I have no access to my homelab. 

* [Ngrok telegram bot](../ngrok)
I created a telegram bot to return public URLs generated by Ngrok service. Follow this guide to expose your local services over the internet.
